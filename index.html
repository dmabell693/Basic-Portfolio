            Hello! My name is Daniel Abell. I was born in Rowlett, TX to two Virginia natives. When I was five my family moved to Richmond, VA, where we lived for the duration of my grade school years. Shortly after graduating high school I enlisted into the United States Marine Corps as a musician. During my four years of service I spent three years on the East Coast and one year on deployment to Afghanistan.

            After completing my military service I used the Post 9/11 GI Bill to attend Cairn University. After three years there I took my first full-time job in the civilian sector, serving as Assistant to the Pastor at GraceWay Bible Church in Hamilton, NJ. Upon earning a B.S. in Biblical Studies at Cairn and completing my time at GraceWay, I attended Jerusalem University College for two years, where I earned an M.A. in Hebrew and Cognate Languages. I am passionate about expanding my proficiency in biblical languages, travel, and now, web development.
